Absolutely! Here's a **complete end-to-end task checklist** to build your full-stack blogging website with:

* React (Frontend)
* Node.js + Express + Mongoose (Backend)
* Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore (Database)
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Admin Panel built into frontend
* Simple password-based admin access (optional upgrade to JWT later)

---

## ✅ **Phase 1: Project Setup**

### 🔧 Initial Setup

* [ ] Create root folder `my-blog-app/`
* [ ] Initialize `backend/` and `frontend/` subfolders
* [ ] Initialize Git repo (optional)

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Migration**

### 🎉 **Backend Status: FULLY WORKING**

* [x] **Azure Cosmos DB Connection**: Successfully connected to your CloudManual Cosmos DB
* [x] **Database Setup**: Created cloudmanual-blog database with posts container
* [x] **Sample Data**: 3 initial posts + 1 test post = 4 total posts
* [x] **API Endpoints**: All working correctly
  - ✅ `GET /api/posts` - Lists all posts with pagination (4 posts found)
  - ✅ `POST /api/posts/admin` - Create posts (JWT protected) ✅ TESTED
  - ✅ `PUT /api/posts/admin/:id` - Update posts (JWT protected)
  - ✅ `DELETE /api/posts/admin/:id` - Delete posts (JWT protected)
  - ✅ `POST /api/posts/admin/login` - Admin authentication ✅ TESTED
* [x] **JWT Authentication**: Working perfectly - login generates valid tokens
* [x] **CRUD Operations**: Successfully created test post via API
* [x] **Environment Configuration**: Cosmos DB credentials properly configured

### 📁 Project Structure

* [x] `backend/app.js` (Express app setup)
* [x] `backend/services/cosmosDB.js` (Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL service)
* [x] `backend/routes/posts-cosmos.js` (CRUD API routes for Cosmos DB)
* [x] `backend/scripts/setup-cosmos.js` (Database setup script)
* [x] `backend/scripts/migrate-to-cosmos.js` (Migration script)

### 🌐 API Endpoints

* [x] `GET /api/posts` – List all blog posts with pagination
* [x] `GET /api/posts/:id` – Get single blog post
* [x] `POST /api/posts` – Create new post (JWT protected)
* [x] `PUT /api/posts/:id` – Update post (JWT protected)
* [x] `DELETE /api/posts/:id` – Delete post (JWT protected)
* [x] `GET /api/analytics` – Admin analytics (JWT protected)

### 🔌 Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Integration

* [x] Install @azure/cosmos SDK and migrate from Mongoose
* [x] Complete CosmosDBService class with CRUD operations
* [x] Configure connection with endpoint and key from `.env`
* [x] Set up database and container with proper indexing

### 🔐 Admin Access (JWT-based)

* [x] JWT middleware to protect admin routes
* [x] Token-based authentication system
* [x] Admin login endpoint with secure password

---

## ✅ **Phase 3: Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS + Axios)**

### 🎨 UI Framework

* [x] Set up React app with Vite + TypeScript
* [x] Configure custom CSS utilities (replaced Tailwind due to compatibility)
* [x] Install Axios and React Router

### 🏠 Pages & Routing

* [x] `/` – Home (list of blog posts)
* [x] `/blog` – Blog list page
* [x] `/blog/:slug` – Single post view
* [x] `/admin` – Admin dashboard (needs JWT integration)
* [ ] `/admin/new` – Create new post
* [ ] `/admin/edit/:id` – Edit existing post
* [x] `/admin/login` – Admin login page

### 🧱 Components

* [x] `BlogCard` – for post previews
* [ ] `PostForm` – used in new/edit (needs JWT integration)
* [x] `Layout/Header/Footer` – Site structure

---

## ✅ **Phase 4: Admin Panel**

### 👤 Access

* [x] JWT-based login form (`/admin/login`) with secure authentication
* [ ] Local storage JWT token management to persist admin auth
* [ ] Update frontend API calls to include JWT headers

### 🛠️ Admin Features

* [ ] List all posts with edit/delete buttons (needs JWT API calls)
* [ ] Add new post (needs JWT integration)
* [ ] Edit post (needs JWT integration)
* [ ] Delete post (needs JWT integration)

---

## ✅ **Phase 5: Enhancements (Optional)**

### 🏷️ Optional Features
